# mapping_seattle
### Project Description/Goal
The goal of this project is to create a resource wherein users can easily view information about restaurants in Seattle. One of the important factors in deciding where to eat is how clean and safe the restaurant is. For this reason, King County inspects all businesses that serve food and assigns a score based on how safe it is to eat there. King County uses factors like food handling, equipment functionality, food temperature, storage area inspection, water temperature, and sanitizers to assure that food is being handled properly through the process of being prepared, all the way to being served. In this project, we will display a data set with health and safety information about restaurants throughout Seattle. Follow the below links to access our web app and data source.

### Main Functions and Applied Libraries
This web app uses javascript as an operative backbone, using functions that access the mapbox API to create a basemap, as well as functions to provide information about points upon user interaction.
To construct this app we used: Mapbox gl js API for mapping and GitHub for version control and deployment.
